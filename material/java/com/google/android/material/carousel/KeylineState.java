/**
 * An arrangement of keylines that are positioned along a scrolling axis.
 *
 * <p>This class is the model used to tell a scrolling item how it should be masked, offset, or
 * treated at certain points (keylines) along the scrolling axis.
 *
 * <p>Keylines are points located along a scrolling axis, relative to the scrolling container's
 * bounds, that tell an item how it should be treated (masked, offset) when it's center is located
 * at a keyline. When between keylines, a scrolling item is treated by interpolating between the
 * states of its nearest surrounding keylines. When put together, a KeylineState contains all
 * keylines associated with a scrolling container and is able to tell a scrolling item how it should
 * be treated at any point (as the item moves) along the scrolling axis, creating a fluid
 * interpolated motion tied to scroll position.
 *
 * <p>Keylines can be either focal or non-focal. A focal keyline is a keyline where items are
 * considered visible or interactable in their fullest form. This usually means where items will be
 * fully unmaksed and viewable. There must be at least one focal keyline in a KeylineState. The
 * focal keylines are important for usability and alignment. Start-aligned strategies should place
 * focal keylines at the beginning of the scroll container, center-aligned strategies at the center
 * of the scroll container, etc.
