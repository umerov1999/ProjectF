/**
 * A {@link CarouselStrategy} that does not resize the original item width and fits as many as it
 * can into the container, cutting off the rest. Cut off items may be resized in order to show an
 * effect of items getting smaller at the ends.
 *
 * Note that this strategy does not adjust the size of large items. Item widths are taken
 * from the {@link androidx.recyclerview.widget.RecyclerView} item width.
 *
 * <p>This class will automatically be reversed by {@link CarouselLayoutManager} if being laid out
 * right-to-left and does not need to make any account for layout direction itself.
 *
