/**
 * <p>QuirkSummary
 *     Bug Id: b/403450605
 *     Description: Quirk denotes that repeating request fails on Samsung Galaxy S25 Ultra when
 *                  Preview uses 4:3 resolutions, VideoCapture uses 16:9 resolutions and HDR is
 *                  enabled. This issue also occurs when only VideoCapture is bound, in which case
 *                  a PRIV stream (for metering repeating) will be bound implicitly. As a result of
 *                  repeating request failure, both preview and video capture will fail.
 *     Device(s): Samsung Galaxy S25 Ultra

     * know what aspect ratio is configured for the Preview. For simplicity, only dynamic range is
     * considered to decide whether to enable this workaround.
