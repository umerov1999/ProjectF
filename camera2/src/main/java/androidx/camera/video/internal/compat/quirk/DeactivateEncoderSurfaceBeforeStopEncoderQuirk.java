/**
 * <p>QuirkSummary
 *     Bug Id: b/196039619
 *     Description: Quirk denotes that the encoder surface needs to be removed from repeating
 *                  request before stop the encoder. Otherwise, the camera will fail if
 *                  {@link MediaCodec} is stopped while frames are still being provided.
 *                  In {@link Recorder}, {@link Recorder#getStreamState()} has to returns
 *                  {@link VideoOutput.StreamState#INACTIVE} when the active recording is being
 *                  stopped. {@link VideoCapture} monitors {@link VideoOutput#getStreamState()}
 *                  and detach the surface from camera if it becomes
 *                  {@link VideoOutput.StreamState#INACTIVE inactive}. So making the
 *                  {@link Recorder} inactive in stopping state will stop the camera from
 *                  producing frames to the {@link MediaCodec} before actually stopping it.
 *     Device(s): All API 21 and 22 devices
