/**
 * Quirk addressing the capture session stuck issue when creating new one before closing the camera
 * device first.
 *
 * <p>QuirkSummary
 *    Bug Id: 359062845
 *    Description: Camera can't stream the image normally if the new capture session is created
 *    before closing the camera device first when a capture session has been opened. This can
 *    happen if the apps bind the UseCases sequentially. The workaround is to close the camera
 *    device before creating the new capture session.
 *    Device(s): Moto e20's front camera.
