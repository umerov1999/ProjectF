/**
 * A [FeatureCombinationResolver] that recursively tries out all combinations of features (according
 * to the preference order) until a supported combination is found.
 *
 * If there are three features {A, B, C} which are ordered with descending priority (i.e. A has
 * highest priority and C has lowest), this class will try out the following combinations in the
 * same order as shown.
 * 1. A, B, C
 * 2. A, B
 * 3. A, C
 * 4. A
 * 5. B, C
 * 6. B
 * 7. C
 *
 * If the first two feature combinations (#1 and #2) are not supported while third combination is
 * supported (with any resolution), the [resolveFeatureCombination] method in this class will return
 * a result using the third feature combination i.e. {A, C}.
 *
 * @property cameraInfoInternal A [CameraInfoInternal] instance to query if a feature combination is
 *   supported.
