/**
 * An opaque, stable identifier for a camera device recognized by CameraX.
 *
 * This identifier is designed to be unique and stable for a specific camera device across
 * application sessions and device connect/disconnect events, provided the underlying system can
 * consistently identify the camera. It serves as a reliable key for uniquely identifying cameras
 * within CameraX APIs, such as in [CameraPresenceListener] callbacks.
 *
 * Applications should not attempt to parse the string representation of this identifier or assume
 * any particular format for its internal value, as it may change across CameraX versions or device
 * implementations.
 *
 * Instances of `CameraIdentifier` are vended by CameraX (e.g., via
 * [CameraInfo.getCameraIdentifier]). Applications should not instantiate this class directly.
 *
 * To re-select a camera for binding, use the [CameraSelector.of] factory method. This class also
 * includes convenience methods like [isOf] to check if this identifier corresponds to a given
 * [Camera] instance.
 *
 * **Selecting a Specific Camera**
 *
 * The primary way to use a `CameraIdentifier` is to re-select that specific camera for binding.
 * This is done by creating a [CameraSelector] with the [CameraSelector.of] static factory method.
 *
 * ```kotlin
 * val cameraProvider = ...
 * val specificId = ... // From a listener or saved preferences
 *
 * // Create a selector that will only match the specific camera
 * val selector = CameraSelector.of(specificId)
 *
 * try {
 * // Bind use cases to this exact camera
 * val camera = cameraProvider.bindToLifecycle(lifecycleOwner, selector, useCaseGroup)
 * } catch (e: IllegalArgumentException) {
 * // This occurs if the camera with the specific ID is no longer available.
 * }
 * ```
 *
 * **Obtaining CameraInfo from an Identifier**
 *
 * To get the [CameraInfo] for a specific `CameraIdentifier`, you must use a [CameraSelector] to
 * query the [CameraProvider]. This ensures that the camera is currently available.
 *
 * ```kotlin
 * val cameraProvider = ...
 * val identifier = ...
 *
 * try {
 * val info = cameraProvider.getCameraInfo(CameraSelector.of(identifier))
 * // Use the CameraInfo object...
 * } catch (e: IllegalArgumentException) {
 * // This exception is thrown if the camera corresponding to the
 * // identifier is not currently available.
 * }
 * ```
 *
 * @see CameraInfo.getCameraIdentifier
 * @see CameraSelector.of
 * @see CameraPresenceListener

     *    This is the most common case and applies to both individual physical cameras and single

     *    simultaneously.
     *
     * This list does **not** represent a single logical camera and its constituent physical
     * sensors. Selecting a single logical camera is done using a list with its single ID.
