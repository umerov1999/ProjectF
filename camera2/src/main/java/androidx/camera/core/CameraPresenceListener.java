/**
 * A listener for changes in camera presence, indicating when cameras are added to or removed
 * from the set of devices that are recognized by the system and usable by CameraX.
 *
 * <p>This listener reports on changes to the set of cameras that CameraX determines can be bound
 * and used. This "usable" set is derived by filtering the list of all available cameras
 * based on several criteria:
 * <ul>
 * <li>The cameras reported as available by the device's framework.</li>
 * <li>The camera meeting the minimum requirements for use with the CameraX library.</li>
 * <li>The application of any {@link CameraSelector} limiters configured to CameraX during
 * initialization.</li>
 * </ul>
 *
 * <p><b>Important:</b> This listener focuses on the <b>presence</b> of usable cameras, not their
 * temporary <b>availability</b> due to other apps using them. It does <b>not</b> report temporary
 * changes in availability, such as when a camera becomes temporarily in-use by another
 * application. For observing those states on an open camera, see {@link CameraState}.
 *
 * <p>Register this listener via
 * {@link androidx.camera.lifecycle.ProcessCameraProvider#addCameraPresenceListener} or
 * {@link androidx.camera.lifecycle.LifecycleCameraProvider#addCameraPresenceListener}.
