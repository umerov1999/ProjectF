/**
 * A {@link MeteringPointFactory} that can convert a {@link View} (x, y) into a
 * {@link MeteringPoint} which can then be used to construct a {@link FocusMeteringAction} to
 * start a focus and metering action.
 *
 * <p>For apps showing full camera preview in a View without any scaling, cropping or
 * rotating applied, they can simply use view width and height to create the
 * {@link DisplayOrientedMeteringPointFactory} and then pass {@link View} (x, y) to create a
 * {@link MeteringPoint}. This factory will convert the (x, y) into the sensor (x, y) based on
 * display rotation and lensFacing.
 *
 * <p>If camera preview is scaled, cropped or rotated in the {@link View}, it is applications'
 * duty to transform the coordinates properly so that the width and height of this
 * factory represents the full Preview FOV and also the (x,y) passed to create
 * {@link MeteringPoint} needs to be adjusted by apps to the  coordinates left-top (0,0) -
 * right-bottom (width, height). For example, if the preview is scaled to 2X from the center and
 * is cropped in a {@link View}. Assuming that the dimension of View is (240, 320), then the
 * width/height of this {@link DisplayOrientedMeteringPointFactory} should be (480, 640).  And
 * the (x, y) from the {@link View} should be converted to (x + (480-240)/2, y + (640 - 320)/2)
 * first.
