/**
 * Modifier for the FPS range for preview-only scenarios in high-speed camera sessions.
 *
 * This class adjusts the FPS range of a repeating capture request when only a preview surface is
 * active in a high-speed camera session. This is done to improve device compatibility by ensuring a
 * lower bound of 30 FPS before recording starts.
 *
 * High-speed sessions typically allow only one preview and one video surface. This modifier ensures
 * that when only the preview is active, the FPS range is adjusted to [30, high-speed fps], which is
 * guaranteed to be supported.
 *
 * See b/405045641 for more detail.
