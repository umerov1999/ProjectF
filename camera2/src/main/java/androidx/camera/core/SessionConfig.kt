/**
 * Represents a session configuration to start a camera session. When used with `camera-lifecycle`,
 * this SessionConfig is expected to be used for starting a camera session (e.g. by being bound to
 * the [androidx.lifecycle.LifecycleOwner] via
 * `androidx.camera.lifecycle.ProcessCameraProvider.bindToLifecycle` API which allows the lifecycle
 * events to start and stop the camera session with this given configuration).
 *
 * It consists of a collection of [UseCase], session parameters to be applied on the camera session,
 * and common properties like the field-of-view defined by [ViewPort], the [CameraEffect], frame
 * rate, required or preferred [GroupableFeature] groups etc.
 *
 * When configuring a session config with `GroupableFeature`s (i.e. [requiredFeatureGroup] or
 * [preferredFeatureGroup] is used), avoid using non-grouping APIs for any feature that is groupable
 * (see [GroupableFeature] to know which features are groupable). Doing so can lead to conflicting
 * configurations and an [IllegalArgumentException]. The following code sample explains this
 * further.
 *
 * @sample androidx.camera.core.samples.configureSessionConfigWithFeatureGroups
 * @property useCases The list of [UseCase] to be attached to the camera and receive camera data.
 *   This can't be empty.
 * @property viewPort The [ViewPort] to be applied on the camera session. If not set, the default is
 *   no viewport.
 * @property effects The list of [CameraEffect] to be applied on the camera session. If not set, the
 *   default is no effects.
 * @property requiredFeatureGroup A set of [GroupableFeature] that are mandatory for the camera
 *   session configuration. If not set, the default is an empty set. See
 *   [SessionConfig.Builder.setRequiredFeatureGroup] for more info.
 * @property preferredFeatureGroup A list of preferred [GroupableFeature] ordered according to
 *   priority in descending order, i.e. a feature with a lower index in the list is considered to
 *   have a higher priority. If not set, the default is an empty list. See
 *   [SessionConfig.Builder.setPreferredFeatureGroup] for more info.
 * @property frameRateRange The desired frame rate range for the camera session. The value must be
 *   one of the supported frame rates queried by [CameraInfo.getSupportedFrameRateRanges] with a
 *   specific [SessionConfig], or an [IllegalArgumentException] will be thrown during
 *   `SessionConfig` binding (i.e. when calling
 *   `androidx.camera.lifecycle.ProcessCameraProvider.bindToLifecycle` or
 *   `androidx.camera.lifecycle.LifecycleCameraProvider.bindToLifecycle`). When this value is set,
 *   no individual [UseCase] can have a target frame rate set (e.g., via
 *   [Preview.Builder.setTargetFrameRate] or `VideoCapture.Builder.setTargetFrameRate`); doing so
 *   will result in an [IllegalArgumentException]. If this value is not set, the default is
 *   [FRAME_RATE_RANGE_UNSPECIFIED], which means no specific frame rate. The range defines the
 *   acceptable minimum and maximum frame rate for the camera session. A **dynamic range** (e.g.,
 *   `[15, 30]`) allows the camera to adjust its frame rate within the bounds, which will benefit
 *   **previewing in low light** by enabling longer exposures for brighter, less noisy images;
 *   conversely, a **fixed range** (e.g., `[30, 30]`) ensures a stable frame rate crucial for
 *   **video recording**, though it can lead to darker, noisier video in low light due to shorter
 *   exposure times.
 * @throws IllegalArgumentException If the combination of config options are conflicting or
 *   unsupported.
 * @See androidx.camera.lifecycle.ProcessCameraProvider.bindToLifecycle
