/**
 * Represents a session configuration to start a camera session. When used with `camera-lifecycle`,
 * this SessionConfig is expected to be used for starting a camera session (e.g. by being bound to
 * the [androidx.lifecycle.LifecycleOwner] via
 * `androidx.camera.lifecycle.ProcessCameraProvider.bindToLifecycle` API which allows the lifecycle
 * events to start and stop the camera session with this given configuration).
 *
 * It consists of a collection of [UseCase], session parameters to be applied on the camera session,
 * and common properties like the field-of-view defined by [ViewPort], the [CameraEffect], required
 * or preferred [Feature]s etc.
 *
 * The following shows the example of how to configure the SessionConfig in CameraX.
 *
 * @sample androidx.camera.lifecycle.samples.bindSessionConfigToLifecycle
 * @property useCases The list of [UseCase] to be attached to the camera and receive camera data.
 *   This can't be empty.
 * @property viewPort The [ViewPort] to be applied on the camera session. If not set, the default is
 *   no viewport.
 * @property effects The list of [CameraEffect] to be applied on the camera session. If not set, the
 *   default is no effects.
 * @property requiredFeatures A set of `Feature` that are mandatory for the camera configuration. An
 *   [IllegalStateException] is thrown during camera configuration if adding all of the required
 *   features is not supported on a device. The [CameraInfo.isFeatureCombinationSupported] API can
 *   be used to check if the required features are supported. Alternatively, the features can be
 *   provided through the `preferredFeatures` property so that some features can be discarded
 *   according to priority if all of them are not supported. Note that [CameraEffect] or
 *   [ImageAnalysis] use case is currently not supported if this parameter is used.
 * @property preferredFeatures A list of preferred [Feature] that should be ordered according to
 *   priority in descending order, i.e. a `Feature` with a lower index in the list will be
 *   considered to have a higher priority. These features will be selected on a best-effort basis
 *   according to the priority. Note that [CameraEffect] or [ImageAnalysis] use case is currently
 *   not supported if this parameter is used.
 * @throws IllegalArgumentException If the combination of config options are conflicting or
 *   unsupported, e.g.
 *     - if any of the required features is not supported on the device
 *     - if same feature is present multiple times in [preferredFeatures]
 *     - if same feature is present in both [requiredFeatures] and [preferredFeatures]
 *     - if [ImageAnalysis] use case is added with [requiredFeatures] or [preferredFeatures]
 *     - if a [CameraEffect] is set with [requiredFeatures] or [preferredFeatures]
 *
 * @See androidx.camera.lifecycle.ProcessCameraProvider.bindToLifecycle
